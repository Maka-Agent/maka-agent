### Hardening phases 1-5

This change set collects the first five maintenance hardening phases from the
Rive deep-read follow-up work.

| Phase | Area | Summary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Runtime permission and usage handling | Made stream watchdog pause/resume accounting robust for concurrent tool calls, added permission timeout handling, integrated Office document abort propagation, and fixed cache/reasoning token usage extraction. |
| 2 | Session JSONL recovery | Recovered sessions with corrupt JSONL rows by parsing message lines independently, surfacing landed corrupt rows as `system_note`, and dropping malformed truncated tail rows. |
| 3 | Bot and OpenGateway abuse controls | Added bot inbound rate and session-binding limits, bounded bot dedupe state, forced bot-bound sessions to `explore`, and capped OpenGateway SSE connections with idle cleanup. |
| 4 | Credential-store secret kind expansion | Extended encrypted credential-store support for bot tokens, bot app secrets, proxy passwords, gateway tokens, and Tavily API keys while preserving legacy API-key/OAuth-token key formats. |
| 5 | Connection credential IPC input hardening | Added shared main-process validation for renderer-controlled connection slugs and API keys before store, credential, or provider side effects. |

### Verification

- Runtime package typecheck/build and focused runtime tests.
- Storage package build and focused session-store tests.
- Desktop main build/typecheck and focused bot/OpenGateway, credential-store,
  settings/web-search, connection IPC, OAuth, and model-provider regression
  suites.
- `git diff --check` before each pushed phase.
